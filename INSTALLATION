Installation instructions for PyCifRW v 4
-----------------------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

Python 2.4 or greater must already be installed.
Self-installing packages for Python (Windows and Mac) are 
available from www.python.org.  All Linux
distributions come with Python included in the base setup.

Use of the dREL functionality requires installation of PLY
(Python Lex Yacc):

    pip install ply

and numpy

    pip install numpy


Installation
------------

(Windows minimal)

A self-installing executable is not currently available for 
Windows.

(All operating systems)
 
1. Download and unpack the file PyCifRW-4.2.tar.gz
2. In directory PyCifRW-4.2, execute the command
 
     python setup.py install 

In Windows this can be accomplished by double-clicking 
the setup.py icon.

Note that commented source code
(.nw files) are available only in the .tar.gz file.

(Linux with compiled scanner)

Alternatively, a 'wheel' package is available for Linux/i686
that contains the precompiled scanner and can be installed
using pip:

    pip install --use-wheel PyCifRW-4.1-cp27-none-linux_i686.whl

Checking the installation
-------------------------

Start the python interpreter from anywhere. Type
"import CifFile".  If this command is
successful, installation is complete.
