Installation instructions for PyCifRW
-------------------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

Python 2.3 or greater must already be installed.
Self-installing packages for Python (Windows and Mac) are 
available from www.python.org.  Almost all Linux
distributions bundle python as standard.

Installation
------------

(Windows minimal - Python 2.7)

Download and execute the file PyCifRW-3.6.11.win32-py2.7.exe

(All operating systems)
 
1. Download and unpack the file PyCifRW-3.6.1.tar.gz
2. In directory PyCifRW-3.6.1, execute the command
 
    'python setup.py install'

In Windows this can be accomplished by double-clicking 
the setup.py icon.

Note that documentation and commented source code
(.nw files) are available only in the .tar.gz file.
The validate.py program is also not provided in 
the windows installer.

Note that the Windows executable installer contains a sped-up
file reading module, which requires additional tools
to create from the 'dumb' .tar.gz distribution.

Checking the installation
-------------------------

Start the python interpreter from anywhere. Type
"import CifFile".  If this command is
successful, installation is complete.
